Fine-Tuning the Code Llama LLM with Weights & Biases
With artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models gaining popularity, ML developers need secure, scalable enterprise-ready tools that optimize developer productivity, streamline cross-functional collaboration, and enable model explainability. This session will showcase how to prepare data from a Q&A chatbot in Snowflake, fine-tune the Llama 2 LLM (specifically Code Llama), compare model candidates, manage the end-to-end model lifecycle leveraging the Weights and Biases platform.
